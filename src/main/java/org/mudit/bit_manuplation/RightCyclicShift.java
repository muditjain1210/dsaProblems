/**
 * Given an integer 30-bit integer N, represented in binary by the array Q[29], Q[28], ï¿½ , Q[0], the
 * right cyclically shifted value of N is the number resulting from shifting every one of its bits
 * to the right (i.e. its binary representation will be Q[0], Q[29], ..., Q[1]).
 * <p>
 * Find the largest possible number resulting from cyclically shifting N to the right. Your function
 * should accept the integer N and return K, the number of shifts necessary to get the largest
 * number.
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * <li>the right cyclic shift of 9,736 by one bit is 4,868
 * <li>the right cyclic shift of 9,736 by two bits is 2,434
 * <li>the right cyclic shift of 9,736 by three bits is 1,217
 * <li>the right cyclic shift of 9,736 by four bits is 268,435,760
 * <li>the right cyclic shift of 9,736 by eleven bits is 809,500,676
 * <p>
 * The function should accept N = 9736 and return K = 11;
